[Video Demo]()



## Project Overview
For this projevt, I created a wuick language reference set for polyglots and language enthusiasts. Users are able to build their own reference library based on the languages and terms they are most interested in having in their personal language libraries. 

Interested in multiple languages? Great! You can have vocabulary for as many languages as you like. You can also choose to only see one language set at time using the language buttons at the top of the application. 

Don't see the language you need? no problem! You can adda new language to your language library! Just click the "Add languague" button in the navigation bar. 


## User and Problem Being Solved
Learning a new language is difficult, but this application is here to help! Language learners can add their most utilized or hardest-to-remmber terms to their own personal digital library!


## Features
- add new langguaes and vocabulary terms
- update current vocabulary terms
- delete vocabulary termns
- filter vocab cards by language
- search for terms and definitons
